<i>The overview of the proposed two-stage framework. Firstly, we propose a multi-task network, SplitNet, for watermark detection, removal  and recovery. Then, we propose the RefineNet to smooth the learned region with the predicted mask and the recovered background from the previous stage. As a consquence, our network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion without any manual intervention. Note that, for clearness, we do not show any skip-connections between all the encoders and decoders.</i>

> The whole project will be released at the end of 2020 (almost).


### Datasets

> The synthesized datasets are still reorganizeing and uploading, it will be released soon.

### Pre-trained Models

> The Pre-trained Models are still reorganizeing and uploading, it will be released soon.


### Demos

> TBD

### Pre-requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train

Besides training our methods, here, we also give an example of how to train the [s2am](https://github.com/vinthony/s2am) under our farmewrok. More details can be founded in the shell scripts.


```
bash examples/evaluation.sh
```

### Test

```
bash examples/test.sh
```
