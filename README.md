<i>The overview of the proposed two-stage framework. Firstly, we propose a multi-task network, SplitNet, for watermark detection, removal  and recovery. Then, we propose the RefineNet to smooth the learned region with the predicted mask and the recovered background from the previous stage. As a consquence, our network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion without any manual intervention. Note that, for clearness, we do not show any skip-connections between all the encoders and decoders.</i>
